This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at http://www.theodinproject.com

The views/new.html.erb file holds 4 Iterations of the same basic form. You need to (un-)comment the specific form you want to display that matches the controllers/user_controller.rb #create method.

* To run the application
run local rails server $ rails s
visit http://localhost:3000/users/new to add new users
visit http://localhost:3000/users/:id/edit to edit an existing user
